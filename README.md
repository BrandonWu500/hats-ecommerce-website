## Description

**BW Hats** is an e-commerce hat shop. It is a personal project that I created for my portfolio. It is not a real shop and uses fake products which I came up with using free images. However, I tried to make it as realistic as possible to accurately simulate how I would create an e-commerce website for a client.

## Technologies

Here is what I used to create BW Hats:

- Figma
- Adobe Illustrator
- Jira
- Shopify
- Next.js
- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind
- Headless UI
